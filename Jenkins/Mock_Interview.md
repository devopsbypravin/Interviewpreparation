Absolutely, Pravin bhai! Here's a set of ðŸ“˜ **mock interview Q&A** (real-world, current-interview style) along with âœ… **Scripted vs Declarative Jenkinsfile examples** â€” all aligned with modern CI/CD pipelines and your DevOps profile.

## ðŸ“˜ **Mock Jenkins Interview Questions & Answers**

---

### ðŸ§  **Q1: What is Jenkins and how does it fit into a CI/CD pipeline?**

**Answer:**  
Jenkins is an open-source CI/CD automation server that enables DevOps teams to build, test, and deploy applications efficiently. It integrates with version control tools like Git, build tools like Maven/Gradle, and deployment tools like Ansible, Docker, and Kubernetes. Jenkins helps automate repetitive tasks, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.

### ðŸ§  **Q2: What is the difference between Freestyle jobs and Pipeline jobs in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**  
- **Freestyle Jobs** are GUI-based, simple to configure, and good for basic automation.
- **Pipeline Jobs** are defined using code (`Jenkinsfile`) and are version-controllable, scalable, and support complex workflows like branching, parallelism, and environment targeting.

---

### ðŸ§  **Q3: Explain Jenkinsfile. What are the two types of pipelines you can write?**

**Answer:**  
A Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines the CI/CD workflow as code. There are two types:
1. **Declarative Pipeline** â€“ Structured, user-friendly syntax. Recommended for most use cases.
2. **Scripted Pipeline** â€“ Based on Groovy; offers more flexibility and custom logic.

### ðŸ§  **Q4: How do you handle sensitive data like passwords or SSH keys in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**  
I use Jenkinsâ€™ **Credentials Manager** to store sensitive data securely. In pipelines, I access them using:
```groovy
withCredentials([usernamePassword(credentialsId: 'ssh-creds', usernameVariable: 'USER', passwordVariable: 'PASS')]) {
    sh 'scp myapp.jar $USER@$HOST:/deploy'
}
```

---

### ðŸ§  **Q5: How do you implement environment-specific deployments (Dev/Stage/Prod) in Jenkins?**

**Answer:**  
I define **parameterized pipelines** and use environment-specific logic:
```groovy
environment {
  DEPLOY_ENV = "${params.ENV}"
}
...
sh "./deploy.sh --env $DEPLOY_ENV"
```
Each environment can also have its own `credentialsId` and config file path.

---

### ðŸ§  **Q6: How do you run parallel steps in Jenkins Pipeline?**

**Answer:**
```groovy
parallel(
  "Unit Tests": { sh 'mvn test' },
  "Static Analysis": { sh 'mvn sonar:sonar' }
)
```

## âœ… **Scripted vs Declarative Jenkinsfile Examples**

---

### ðŸ”· **Declarative Pipeline (Recommended)**

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any

  tools {
    maven 'maven3'
  }

  parameters {
    string(name: 'ENV', defaultValue: 'dev', description: 'Environment to deploy to')
  }

  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/your-org/demo-app.git'
      }
    }

    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
      }
    }

    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn test'
      }
    }

    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sh "./deploy.sh --env ${params.ENV}"
      }
    }
  }

  post {
    success {
      echo 'Pipeline completed successfully!'
    }
    failure {
      echo 'Something went wrong.'
    }
  }
}
```

---

### ðŸ”· **Scripted Pipeline (Groovy-Based)**

```groovy
node {
  stage('Checkout') {
    git 'https://github.com/your-org/demo-app.git'
  }

  stage('Build') {
    def mvnHome = tool 'maven3'
    sh "${mvnHome}/bin/mvn clean install"
  }

  stage('Test') {
    sh 'mvn test'
  }

  stage('Deploy') {
    def env = 'dev' // or dynamically set it
    sh "./deploy.sh --env ${env}"
  }

  stage('Notify') {
    echo 'Build done'
  }
}
```

- Bundle this into a **Jenkins Masterclass PDF**?
- Add **Jenkins + Maven + Docker pipeline** with environment tags?
- Build out a **multi-branch pipeline for GitFlow**?

Letâ€™s turn this into your **CI/CD playbook**, Pravin bhai!
