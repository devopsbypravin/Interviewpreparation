ðŸŽ¯ Scenario-Based Questions (Real-World DevOps Use Cases)
âœ… Scenario 1: Production Deployment Pipeline
You're tasked with setting up a Maven-based build pipeline in Jenkins. Walk through how you'd go from code commit to deployment.

ðŸ§  Expected Discussion:

Use mvn clean install

Run unit & integration tests via maven-surefire-plugin

Package into .jar or .war

Archive artifact and deploy using mvn deploy to Nexus/Artifactory

Use Maven goals as Jenkins build steps

âœ… Scenario 2: Dependency Conflict
You're seeing build failures due to conflicting library versions. How would you debug and resolve it?

ðŸ§  Expected Discussion:

Use mvn dependency:tree to identify conflicts

Use <dependencyManagement> to enforce correct version

Exclude transitive dependency from specific artifact

âœ… Scenario 3: Project Bootstrapping
Your team wants to start a Spring Boot project. What is the fastest and most standardized way to set it up using Maven?

ðŸ§  Expected Discussion:

Use Spring Initializr

Generate Maven project with selected dependencies

Import into IDE

Customize pom.xml as needed

âœ… Scenario 4: Environment-Specific Builds
You want to run different builds for staging and production. How would you manage that in Maven?

ðŸ§  Expected Discussion:

Use Maven profiles (<profiles>)

Each profile includes environment-specific configs or dependencies

Trigger via CLI: mvn clean install -Pstaging

âœ… Scenario 5: Maven in Microservice Architecture
Youâ€™re building multiple microservices. How do you manage them in Maven?

ðŸ§  Expected Discussion:

Use multi-module Maven project

Parent POM manages shared dependencies

Each service is a submodule with its own POM
