üß† üéØ Scenario-Based Ansible Questions (Real-World Situations)
‚úÖ Scenario 1: Web App Deployment
"You're tasked with deploying a Java web application with Nginx as a reverse proxy on 3 environments (Dev, Stage, Prod). How would you structure your Ansible project using roles and inventory files?"
Expected Answer:
Use separate inventories for each environment (inventory/dev, inventory/stage, inventory/prod)


Create roles: java_app, nginx, firewall


Use group_vars and host_vars to manage env-specific configs


Use tags for selective execution


Vault for secrets like DB credentials or SSL certs



‚úÖ Scenario 2: Config Drift Detection
"Your production servers show unexpected configuration drift. How can you use Ansible to detect and remediate it automatically?"
Expected Answer:
Use check_mode: true to detect drifts


Integrate periodic dry-run execution using cron + ansible-playbook --check


Compare with Git-tracked versioned playbooks


Auto-remediate using CI/CD triggers (e.g., Jenkins scheduled jobs)



‚úÖ Scenario 3: Infrastructure Auto-Scaling
"Your AWS environment is auto-scaling. How would you make sure newly launched EC2 instances are automatically configured using Ansible?"
Expected Answer:
Use a dynamic inventory script (e.g., aws_ec2 plugin)


Use tags (like Environment=prod) to target specific EC2s


Integrate with Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks + Lambda ‚Üí trigger Ansible playbook post-launch


Maintain immutable infra with golden AMIs + minor configs via Ansible



‚úÖ Scenario 4: Secure Credentials in Playbooks
"You're managing secrets like database passwords in playbooks. What's the best way to secure and reuse them across projects?"
Expected Answer:
Use Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive files


Store encrypted files in Git (e.g., vault.yml)


Decrypt using ansible-vault or --ask-vault-pass


Optionally use Ansible Lookup plugins to pull secrets from AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault



‚úÖ Scenario 5: Multi-Cloud Provisioning
"You are working on a hybrid cloud setup (AWS + Azure). How can you use Ansible to configure both environments together?"
Expected Answer:
Use respective dynamic inventories for both providers


Separate roles for AWS and Azure-specific tasks


Use delegate_to, tags, and conditional logic (when:) to separate tasks


Secure creds using Vault or environment-specific vars

üéØ Real-World Scenario-Based Ansible Questions
‚úÖ Scenario 6: Application Rollback
"You've deployed an update using an Ansible playbook and it caused application downtime. How would you implement a rollback strategy using Ansible?"
Expected Approach:
Maintain versioned deployments using symlinks or backup directories


Use a rollback.yml playbook with conditional logic to restore the previous version


Store previous config/packages in a backup role or artifact repo



‚úÖ Scenario 7: Managing Large Inventory
"You need to manage thousands of hosts split across multiple regions. How do you organize your Ansible inventory and ensure scalability?"
Expected Approach:
Use dynamic inventory (e.g., AWS EC2 plugin)


Structure hosts into groups and nested groups


Use group_vars and host_vars for clean config separation


Use tags for targeted execution



‚úÖ Scenario 8: Updating TLS Certificates
"You need to rotate SSL/TLS certs across 50 servers with zero downtime. How would you automate this using Ansible?"
Expected Approach:
Use copy or template module to place new certs


Use a handler to reload web server only when cert changes


Use a serial execution block in the playbook to restart a few servers at a time (e.g., serial: 5)


Validate using a uri module to test HTTPS response



‚úÖ Scenario 9: Compliance Enforcement
"Your company mandates that all servers must have specific security settings (e.g., SSH config, audit logs). How would you enforce this using Ansible?"
Expected Approach:
Create a compliance role


Use Ansible‚Äôs lineinfile, copy, or blockinfile to enforce SSHD settings


Run playbooks in check mode on cron to audit config drift


Integrate with compliance tools like OpenSCAP or auditd



‚úÖ Scenario 10: Real-Time Playbook Trigger
"A Git repo push should trigger an Ansible playbook to update the application on a dev environment. How would you set this up?"
Expected Flow:
Use webhooks from GitHub/Bitbucket to trigger a Jenkins job


Jenkins executes ansible-playbook with the latest code pull


Use inventory targeting for dev group only


Add --extra-vars to pass Git commit metadata or env info dynamically
