Here's **another power-packed set** of **advanced + scenario-based Ansible questions** — perfect for interviews, self-assessment, or even mentoring juniors.

## 🔧 **🔁 More Advanced Ansible Questions**

11. **How do you manage different environments (Dev/Stage/Prod) using Ansible in a clean, reusable way?**

12. **Explain the use of `include_tasks` vs `import_tasks`. When would you use one over the other?**

13. **How does Ansible handle asynchronous task execution? How would you run a long-running task and not wait for it to complete?**

14. **What are Ansible facts? How are they gathered, and how can you disable them for performance improvement?**

15. **How can you use Ansible with containers (e.g., configuring Docker or deploying to Kubernetes)?**

16. **What is a `callback plugin` in Ansible and how can you use it to customize playbook output or logging?**

17. **How can you use `lookup` and `with_` loops together in Ansible for dynamic templating or advanced configurations?**

18. **How do you debug Ansible playbooks efficiently during development and in production pipelines?**

19. **Explain how Ansible can be integrated into a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. What’s the flow?**

20. **What is the role of `meta` in Ansible roles? How do you define dependencies and role metadata using it?**

## 🎯 **Real-World Scenario-Based Ansible Questions**

### ✅ **Scenario 6: Application Rollback**
> **"You've deployed an update using an Ansible playbook and it caused application downtime. How would you implement a rollback strategy using Ansible?"**

Expected Approach:
- Maintain `versioned deployments` using symlinks or backup directories
- Use a `rollback.yml` playbook with conditional logic to restore the previous version
- Store previous config/packages in a backup role or artifact repo

---

### ✅ **Scenario 7: Managing Large Inventory**
> **"You need to manage thousands of hosts split across multiple regions. How do you organize your Ansible inventory and ensure scalability?"**

Expected Approach:
- Use **dynamic inventory** (e.g., AWS EC2 plugin)
- Structure hosts into **groups and nested groups**
- Use **group_vars** and **host_vars** for clean config separation
- Use **tags** for targeted execution

---

### ✅ **Scenario 8: Updating TLS Certificates**
> **"You need to rotate SSL/TLS certs across 50 servers with zero downtime. How would you automate this using Ansible?"**

Expected Approach:
- Use `copy` or `template` module to place new certs
- Use a handler to reload web server only when cert changes
- Use a **serial** execution block in the playbook to restart a few servers at a time (e.g., `serial: 5`)
- Validate using a `uri` module to test HTTPS response

---

### ✅ **Scenario 9: Compliance Enforcement**
> **"Your company mandates that all servers must have specific security settings (e.g., SSH config, audit logs). How would you enforce this using Ansible?"**

Expected Approach:
- Create a **compliance role**
- Use Ansible’s `lineinfile`, `copy`, or `blockinfile` to enforce SSHD settings
- Run playbooks in **check mode** on cron to audit config drift
- Integrate with compliance tools like OpenSCAP or auditd

---

### ✅ **Scenario 10: Real-Time Playbook Trigger**
> **"A Git repo push should trigger an Ansible playbook to update the application on a dev environment. How would you set this up?"**

Expected Flow:
- Use **webhooks** from GitHub/Bitbucket to trigger a Jenkins job
- Jenkins executes `ansible-playbook` with the latest code pull
- Use inventory targeting for `dev` group only
- Add `--extra-vars` to pass Git commit metadata or env info dynamically
